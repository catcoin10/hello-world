Dogecoin

Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that was initially designed as a "joke", but it has 4 perks that not many people know about, which I
will get to later. Dogecoin is like bitcoin in the software that it runs on. Dogecoin, unlike bitcoin (which is the 1st perk of
Dogecoin) has unlimited coin generation, with generation significantly slowing down after the first few months of its existence.
The second perk is that banks do not think about dogecoin because of the reason above, making it a people's currency. Unlike
bitcoin, there is a foundation that is created by the founders because the founders are not anonymous. (Their names are
Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer). Dogecoin, like bitcoin, hit an all time high around January 1st of 2018. The market cap was
over 2 billion. This should happen again to make the Adobe proprietary software managers ashamed of creating Dogecoin.

Bottom line:
To escape the banks control, buy dogecoin because the banks do not care about dogecoin.
