Hello, world. I am catcoin10 and I am a github user. I am planning on creating in the near future a program that generates
a username from a password using SHA256 in python. It will use hundreds of keywords that sound cool and concatenate them
to make the password distinct and fairly easy to remember. It will be in a different repository.

Now, back to this repository. This is the intro repository where I am proving to my programming teacher and myself that I know how
to code.

My name is Zeus. I am friends with and the brother of Poseidon and I am 3 thousand years old.
