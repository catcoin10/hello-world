Hello, world. I am catcoin10 and I am a github user.

Now, back to this repository. This is the intro repository where I am proving to my programming teacher and myself that I know how
to code.

My name is Zeus. I am friends with and the brother of Poseidon and I am 3 thousand years old. I use Python to write programs.
I write Python programs to practice my coding abilities in the computer. This repository contains information about cryptocurrency,
left wing politics, and more. (The politics category probably won't be frequently updated, I just want to prove I'm a liberal.)
